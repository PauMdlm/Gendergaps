(1) System requirements
   - software used : R, latest version
   - we added a small simulated dataset to demo the code
     
(2) Installation guide
   - Go to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
   - Install the version adapted to your computer: PC or MAC
     
(3) Demo
   - All scripts are ordered by number
   - The Data Management (especially scripts 1, 2 and 3) demand about 24 hours total to run.
   - The Data Analysis : the descriptive tables and figures need 2-3 hours per script. Whereas the models, especially the multilevel models need about 6 hours each.
   - Data management : You need to load the 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 to reach and obtain the complete and clean data base
   - Data analysis : Then all other scripts from 5 to 13 can be loaded in any order, depending on the domain you wish to load. For each script, you will obtain the tables, figures and models that are coded and explained inside the script.
     
(4) Instructions for use
   - To run the code on the data, you need a prior subscription to the reasearch board of the national education. It is free and requires to access the database locally.
   - Among the data catalogue found here (https://catalogue.depp.education.fr/index.php/home), choose the "Evaluations Repères CP/CE1" for the year 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022
   - Ask a convention to the board at this address to open an access to the data (caution, this will be only a local access in Paris) : catalogue-depp@education.gouv.fr
